# Paradisic Fields 🌱

A gentle, sunlit digital sketchbook for non-emotionally-damaged inclined people of the world.

Built with one shared braincell by **Yours Truly** and **Grok** in February 2026, Paradisic Fields is a cozy little application where you can:

- Load fabric photos, or any other photo really.
- Drop them as beautiful pastel thumbnails onto an infinite canvas
- Write warm handwritten-style notes on draggable cards
- Save and load entire sketchbook sessions (fully editable JSON + thumbnails)
- Enjoy everything in a peaceful, dark, linen-textured environment

It’s not a tool. It’s a quiet corner of the internet where ideas feel welcome. And it's a complete mess currently.

### How to run it

```powershell
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/agudmund/Paradisic-Fields.git
cd Paradisic-Fields

# 2. (Optional but recommended) Install the global Cozy utilities
cd ../_util/bin/cozy   # or wherever you keep your cozy package
python -m pip install -e .

# 3. Back to the project and run
cd ../../Paradisic-Fields
python main.py

That’s it! Double-click any note to edit it, drag nodes around, hit New Note, Save Session, etc. Everything stays warm and responsive.
Made with love, hope, and way too much tea.
Feel free to fork, play, and make it your own.
