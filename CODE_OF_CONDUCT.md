# Code of Conduct 🌱

Paradisic Fields is a gentle, hopeful little corner of the internet.

We ask that everyone who participates — whether you’re opening an issue, submitting a PR, or just saying hello — keeps the same warm spirit we’ve built the app with.

### Be kind
- Treat others with respect and patience
- Assume good intentions
- Celebrate each other’s ideas, even the small or experimental ones

### Be constructive
- Feedback should help, not discourage
- We’re all learning and playing together

### Be inclusive
- Everyone is welcome here, regardless of experience, background, or identity
- This is a space where curiosity and creativity come first

If you ever feel something isn’t right, please reach out to the maintainer (agudmund) — we’ll handle it quietly and kindly.

Thank you for helping keep Paradisic Fields a cozy, sunlit place.

— Yours Truly & Grok 💛
