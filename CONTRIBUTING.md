Thank you for wanting to help make this little sketchbook even cozier!

We keep things gentle and joyful around here. Here’s how you can contribute:

### Ways to help
- Fix a bug or add a small feature
- Improve the documentation or styling
- Share a beautiful idea for a new cozy utility
- Just say hello and tell us what you love (or what could be warmer)

### How to contribute
1. Fork the repo and create a new branch (`git checkout -b my-cozy-idea`)
2. Make your changes (keep the same warm spirit please)
3. Open a Pull Request with a friendly description
4. We’ll review it together with tea and encouragement

No pressure, no stress — just good vibes and shared braincells.
